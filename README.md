## Help
You get 6 guesses to get the correct answer.
On each guess this happens:
if you guess correctly your guess is shown in green

if you guess is in the correct region you guess is shown in yellow and a compass direction is shown pointing towards the answer from your guess

if you guess incorrectly then your guess is shown with no change in background colour.

if you do not get the guess in 6 attempts and you press the new "Answer" button, you will see the answer.

## DISCLAIMER
This code is also disgusting the method I use to go between gamestates is horrendous and unindicative of how I would program this had I done it today
